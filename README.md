Explanation
HTML Structure: Defines a basic calculator layout using buttons and an input field for display.
CSS: Provides styling for the calculator and buttons to make them visually appealing and responsive.
JavaScript: Implements three functions:
appendToDisplay(value): Appends the clicked button value to the display field.
clearDisplay(): Clears the display field.
calculate(): Evaluates the expression in the display field using JavaScript's eval() function and updates the display with the result.
This example provides a basic calculator functionality. For production use or more complex calculations, consider additional error handling and security measures, especially if handling user input that may include potentially malicious content.
